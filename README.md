- RSS 2020, Early Career Award Keynote + Q&A: Jeannette Bohg [[Video](https://youtu.be/yD_0lUYo5fI)] <br />
<small>Robotic Grasping of Novel Objects [[NeurIps 2016](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2006/hash/22722a343513ed45f14905eb07621686-Abstract.html)] DB for Supervised Learning (SVM) etc to find a good grasping point per pixel. Prof Jeanette made this contribution [ [Learning grasping points with shape context](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889009001699) ] with feature engineering (edge features & shape context [orientation etc]). From 2D grasping points to 6D grasping pose. Current works [ [Google Arm Farm](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/03/deep-learning-for-robots-learning-from.html), [DexNet](https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/) ]. Insights by Prof Jeannette - Open loop does not work, avoiding collision is constraining, 2D grasping points are not enough. So Continuos Feedback & Re-Planning is important, Exploit the environment, action representations matter. [Real-time Perception meets Reactive Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03512), [Probabilistic Articulated Real-Time Tracking for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04871) and [Riemannian Motion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02854) were important updates. </small> <br /><br />

<small> More works on Robots actually learning with contact constraints: [Planar in-hand manipulation via motion cones](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0278364919880257), [A novel type of compliant and underactuated robotic hand for dexterous grasping](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364915592961), [An autonomous manipulation system based on force control and optimization](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10514-013-9365-9) etc.
Q Learning (DoubleQ) in Outer loop and model free RL (A3C) is used in the Inner loop. </small><br /><br />
